My first screen displays the list of astrological signs with the name of the sign as well as pretty little pictures :

Each item is clickable. So just click on a sign to be redirected to the detailed page

***"Activity nÂ°2"***

My second activity displays the specific description of the selected item :
- A picture
- Name of the sign
- Starting date
- Ending date
